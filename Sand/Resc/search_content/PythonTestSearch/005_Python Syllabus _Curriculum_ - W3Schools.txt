Sandbox and Lab Environment
Python, like any other programming language, is best learned by working hands-on with code.
Easily try code with our "Try it Yourself" editor.
Here, you can edit Python code and view the result:
Example
print("Hello, World!")
Try it Yourself »
If you want to explore more and host your project, we have a feature called
Spaces
that allows you to build, test and deploy Python code and other backend languages.
Here you get a secure sandbox environment called Spaces, where you can practice coding and test projects in real-time.
Spaces allow you to test, build, and deploy code. This includes a W3Schools subdomain, hosting, and secure SSL certificates.
Spaces require no installation and run directly in the browser.
Features include:
Collaboration
File navigator
Terminal & log
Package manager
Database
Environment manager
Analytics

Python Certification
W3Schools offers an end-of-pathway certification program.
Here you can take exams to get certified.
The Python exam is a test that summarizes the W3Schools Python syllabus.
After passing the exam you get the "Certified Python Developer" Certification.
There are two different types of certifications:
Non-adaptive
Adaptive
The non-adaptive is pass or no pass.
The adaptive certification is adaptive and graded; students will get a grade from intermediate, advanced to professional.
